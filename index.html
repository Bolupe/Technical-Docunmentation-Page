          <code> "This is an intresting course that involves more practical than theory, in fact the lecturer told us that our exams would be in an objective format! which of course got everyone in the class excited. Here's the plot twist, the practical wasn't beans, I'm the group leader, so of course you know what that meeans ðŸ˜¢. On the bright side, it was a great experience in all and I look forward to getting an 'A' in the course, same as others. Amen  " </code>
